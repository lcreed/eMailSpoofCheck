# eMailSpoofCheck
## Simple google apps script to check for spoofed message

This script performs a very basic check of the email header looking for a fail message from spf or dkim checks.  If found, it sends the message to spam and apples a label so you can easily identify the script that placed the message in the spam folder.

This functionality is part of a larger suite of Gmail Management Functions I'm building to reduce the amount of time wasted on worthless or unwanted messages.
